        <p class="para-copy">I'm Matt and I have done a lot of things. Currently I work as a UX designer and web developer for Ritz Marketing. I also design sound for commercials and podcasts, as well as teach/train the staff on how to best leverage tech and business software.<br><br> I’ve done a lot of things since being a theatre major from bartending to construction to prison guard. I wasn’t happy in any of these jobs, so when my kids were born I decided to stay home and teach myself web development. I had a lot of fun doing this but I found I was more concerned how and why the app or page functioned this way and designing something other than canned websites. I found UX through a local meetup group and I was hooked.<br><br> This is what I focus on during the week, solving design problems and then developing them. On the weekends I play music, travel, and hang out with my wife and kids. My journey is far from over but for the first time in a long time I am thoroughly enjoying it.</p>

          <p class="article-text para-copy num1">One of my main objectives when coming to ritz was redesigning the website. All of my predecessors have attempted this with the same results. Making a website for the company that you work for should be pretty straight forward. Stakeholders are in house, graphic artist at your disposal, and do it in a style that works for you. So I find myself asking one question, How is this time going to be different?</p>

          <p class="article-text para-copy num1">One of the best parts of my job is not knowing from day to day what I will be doing. Matt can you research this software and tell us what you think? Do have any country sounding music for a tv spot? Can you teach everyone how to use FTP our client needs us to start using it? This makes it fun to go to work everyday. I never know what interesting problem I get to try and solve.</p>

          <p class="article-text para-copy num1">My creative journey started in high school when on a whim I decided to try out for the school musical. After finding out that I could sing and act my creativity blossomed. I definitely took a long detour from feeding that creative side the way that I should. When my kids were born I decided to find out what I really was meant to do. I didn’t want my kids to grow up with a parent that never tried do something they were passionate about. </p>
