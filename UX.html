        <p class="para-copy">At Ritz I get the opportunity to do a lot of things. We are a small group so this affords me the opportunity to stretch out creatively. In my tenure at Ritz I have had the opportunity to design sound for podcasts and commercials, do voice overs for local radio spots, and create ad campaigns for our customers as well as our sister company Crash Studios. </p>

        <p class="para-copy">Music is all about capturing the mood. When I am designing sound at Ritz it’s usually for something that already exist. I already have a good starting point with visuals and a script. I still ask plenty questions and do as much research as I can about the audience for the piece. You have to know your audience, without this you can drastically change the vibe of a piece of work.</p>

          <p class="para-copy ritz-copy">My most recent composition was for a car dealership in Arkansas. The commercial was a 30 second spot meant to air in the dealership as well as on the local networks in the market where the dealer is located. <br><br>
          The spot was already done and our digital wizard Melvin was looking for some music. He found some examples for the owner of the business but they just weren’t right. Melvin asked if I could design some music for the spot and sent my the commercial. He said the owner wanted country music like Keith Urban. Upon some research I found that the town was rural and mostly comprised of blue collar, hard working people. I started to play around with banjo tracks but it just didn’t feel right. I continued to watch the commercial over and over and decided to try some texas slide guitar riffs and there it was. I had found the sound that fit. I worked the track a little more and added and subtract instruments so the GM could have some options to pick from.

Will the director of crash was looking for some music for his two podcast that he was finalizing. The music needed to be upbeat and digital. I set out to find the exact sound that would represent these two podcast.<br><br>
          Crash cast is crash studios everything podcast that interviews our clients and local personalities of the queen city. While we went over several different variations of the music this was the final product.<br><br>

          Superfast podcast is a sixty second podcast where guest of crash cast are subjected to a lightning round of questions on all subjects. We decided to make the two music tracks different since they would be released within days of each other and we wanted to not have confusion. <br><br>

          <p class="para-copy">We are also in the process of beta testing multiple Google Ads for crash. Crash had their grand opening in September and driving as many eyes to the business is priority number one. I was asked to craft a campaign that would inform us where to spend our ad dollars for Crash. We needed to advertise ourselves as a multi-purpose studio. I decided to test a general ad about Crash and then one for each of our specialties; photography studio, video production, and podcasting.
          <br><br>
          I found that after 30 days that our photography ad is far outperforming the rest. I have set up Google Analytics for our website and next steps will be tuning our ad experience to drive Crashes business goals.

        <h3 class="heading-3" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Email Signatures</h3>
        <p class="para-copy ">
          Week one at my journey at Ritz presented me with a all to common problem, email signatures. The issue they were having was the sig was breaking down after any reply and as for mobile it was pretty much fractured to start with. There was my problem to solve, they needed a signature that would stand up to redirects and replies while maintaining structure across all platforms and clients. I looked into the email sig that everybody was supposedly using and found out that it had been coded using divs and not the standard table format used for email. I also discovered that not everyone was using the signature and that they were using self created ones. My first step was to research any new best practices for an email signatures. I found after an exhaustive search that my best option was to stick with a design that would fit within the bounds of a mobile device without having to worry about resizing. The design needed to include the business logo and a confidentiality agreement along with the normal information name, title, phone, as well as social links.

          <p class="para-copy">
           I wireframed some design options on a whiteboard, because of the simplicity of the signature I didn’t need do any prototyping. The best two designs were voted on by the creative team and presented to our company president. Our finalist then went through compliance testing through email on acid and then manuel testing though the top 5 email clients on the market. After the signature passed all of the testing requirements I made a master file of all of the employee signatures and used github as a repository for the file.

        <p class="para-copy">
          One of the things that I discussed with my boss before I started working at Ritz was having at the very least one stand up meeting a week with the creative team to discuss what we are doing and working on, hot projects, and if we need any help. We are a five person team that is comprised of 3 graphic designers, 1 video and animation person, and me the designer/developer. We have to work insync with one another or things get out of hand pretty quickly. He said that they had previously talked about starting these meetings and was happy that I had interest in them. I also discussed doing some sort of weekly skills training for the group and whoever else at the company wanted to attend. They thought this was a great idea and Ritz School for Kids Who Don't _____ good was born. At our first stand up meeting we discussed formatting and content, and it was decided that I would be the first presenter and that we would discuss The internet of things and web development for a month. This went off with a great success. I started with how the internet works and detailed how info is sent and how your ISP works as well as web protocols. Week two was all about web pages and how they are built and hosted. Week three we took a deeper dive into web pages with HTML and CSS
