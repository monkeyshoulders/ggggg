        <p class="para-copy" style="line-height: 3rem;">I never thought of myself as an artist or a creative person when I was growing up. I was into sports and I participated when I had to but never thought that I had a creative side. The day in high school that I skipped soccer practice and went with some friends to audition for the school musical changed my life. I didn't know I could sing or act or dance, but soon found out that I was very creative and able. This changed my college plans and I decided to major in theatre at Catawba College, but alas my dreams were cut short due to life. I began to work where I could find it and not believing that I could be more. Fast forward some years and my wife and I have a daughter, we made the decision that I would stay home and find out what I wanted to do with my life. I did a lot of research and more research and testing and I came to the conclusion that I could teach myself how to be a web developer and design amazing websites. I tried to leverage everything that I could that was free first. I then found Udemy and then Udacity. I formalized my education and embarked on a frontend web developer from Udacity, and I learned so much. This still wasn't enough. The sites I created in tutorials were all the same and I knew there had to be a better way. I found the Charlotte UX meetup and attended a talk about "What is UX". This meetup again changed my course and I found a whole new world and way to levage past skills and creative experiences to create new and meaningful things. Now I do this for a living, I am a hybrid designer/developer and couldn't be happier. I even love to share what I do with others to help them find there place where they belong. I really love what I do and I want to learn and grow and share my experiences with the world.</p>

        <p class="para-copy">I was given the opportunity to teach at Tech Talent South in April of 2018. This was something that I knew I wanted to do but I was totally unsure if I was even qualified. I had some great teachers and mentors while learning development, how was I going to measure up them? What if one of my students asked me a question that I didnâ€™t know? I had reservations but I knew that I needed to get over these fears and trust that my teachers had taught me well enough to handle whatever was thrown my way. </p>

          <h3 class="heading-3 ritz-copy" style="font-size: 5rem">TTS</h3>
          <p class="para-copy ritz-copy">My first class was Intro to web development and design. I only had five students in the class and most of them were incredibly novice. I quickly found that I was pretty good at teaching and talking about what I knew and was passionate about. The class was 4 weeks long and we met twice a week and covered topics on HTML5, CSS, Javascript, responsive design, advanced CSS, and bootstrap. The class culminated with a project that where the students had to design and develop a website of their choosing. I learned so much teaching this class and was so proud of my students. I got the opportunity to teach this again this past September.

This was quite a jump up from where I was before. TTS was in a kind of bind, but I had done so well with the intro class that they wanted me to try my hand at teaching Ruby development. I had learned the basics of Ruby and had done fullstack Javascript development, but I had my reservations once again. I had 6 weeks to get rock solid with Ruby and the Rails framework. This was a challenge but quickly picked up more than enough to teach the class and actually build stout applications. This was such a great experince for me to learn and then teach the material immediately. I had to really focus on how to learn something deeply and then teach it to brand new devlopers. The classes were awesome and I had some amazing experiences on this journey. I was even able to get one of my students a job before the class was over. I learned a very valuable lesson this summer and that is if you work hard enough you can really acheive anything.

        <h3 class="heading-3">My first BIG break</h3>
        <p class="para-copy" style="margin: 4rem 12rem; line-height: 2.5rem">
          While working as a freelance developer you have gigs that come along that are really awesome and can not only provide a paycheck but teach you so much. I had the privledge to work with The Big Idea Group last Christmas. Big has only one developer and he is quite talented. He was going on a vacation and they needed someone to fill in while he was gone. I was hired to shadow him for 1 week and then fly solo. My primary responsibility was to develop responsive emails and deploy them via the salesforce software. I would get the PSD files from the designers and slice the images. I then would drop the images into the template and change any text and background colors. This would have been easy if I had any experience with photoshop. I learned on the fly how to use photoshop and salesforce and a new code base and a filing system. The people at Big were so awesome and I survived my solo week with flying colors. Here are some of the emails that I coded.
